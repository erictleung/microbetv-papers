## Repository Organization

Each podcast show will have its own directory in `shows/`. Contained within
will be a Markdown file with links to the papers discussed in the episodes
along with a BibTeX file containing the references for those papers.

There will be a Makefile with build commands to then aggregate the Markdown
notes and BibTeX files into a single master file for each.
